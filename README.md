## Game Rule
1. Click the **START** button to begin. The game status indicator switches from RED to GREEN. The game will begin 3 seconds after the light turns GREEN.
2. Simon flashes a colored button. Click the same color button to repeat the signal.
3. Simon adds one more signal to the sequence. Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons in order.
4. Continue playing and repeating the sequences. The game speeds up after the 5th, 9th, and 13th signals.
5. If you fail to repeat a sequence or take more than 5 seconds, you lose, Simon responds by flashing all four buttons simultaneously five times. The game status indicator switches to RED, and you must click the **START** button to begin a new game.
6. Your last game's progress is shown to the right of the START button, and the all-time highest score is shown to the left of the START button.
